iOS Support
===========

Install pods: `npx pod-install`.

```
==================== DEPRECATION NOTICE =====================
Calling `pod install` directly is deprecated in React Native
because we are moving away from Cocoapods toward alternative
solutions to build the project.
* If you are using Expo, please run:
`npx expo run:ios`
* If you are using the Community CLI, please run:
`yarn ios`
=============================================================
```
That's great except I don't seem to be using Yarn.

To do version revs, use Xcode or edit `project.pbxproj`.

`npx uri-scheme add tricordarr --ios`
