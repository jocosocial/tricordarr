Design and UX guidelines that I remember to write down.

General
-------

* Every screen should have Help. Whether directly in the header or under a menu.

Screen Headers / Menus
----------------------

* Most screens should have an Actions Menu (three dots) in the upper right.
* Common actions, then privileged actions separated on both sides by divider, help
* Other than the Menu, acceptable Header buttons are [Filter, Sort, Search].
* If just help, skip the menu and use that as the icon where the menu would be

FABs
----

* Screens where there is a "create" action should have that Create be in the form of a FAB

Icons
