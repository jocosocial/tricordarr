Deprecation
===========

These modules are unspported and need to go:

* [@georstat/react-native-image-cache](https://github.com/georstat/react-native-image-cache)
* [react-native-fs](https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs)
* [react-native-encrypted-storage](https://github.com/emeraldsanto/react-native-encrypted-storage)
* [react-native-hyperlink](https://github.com/obipawan/react-native-hyperlink)
** https://github.com/joshswan/react-native-autolink was suggested as an alternative.
** Patched around the `A props object containing a "key" prop is being spread into JSX` issue.
