# App Store Review

## Apple

### Notes

The app will start with a setup wizard. Press the green "Next" button and not the blue "Pre-Registration" button. Pick the "Beta" server and press Save. Proceed through the wizard and log in using the sign-in credentials provided above.

If you want to proceed through the blue "Pre-Registration", you can also do that by changing the server URL to the same "Beta" server. It will have less features available but will allow you to complete.

There are three dummy accounts that you can interact with: "sam", "heidi", "james".

The intended audience of this app are attendees of a one-week "nerd" cruise. User content is only available when physically on the ship (where the server lives) and is inaccessible after the sailing. There are no in-app purchases or other paid content. This is a free app offered by volunteers in partnership with the charter cruise organizers. The server and app are both open source.

Twitarr has extensive moderation capabilities. Users report content to a volunteer team of moderators who will take action according to the moderator guidelines. NSFW content is not allowed at all.

### Potential Complications

Whats New section?

2.4.4ASR & NR Apps should never suggest or require a restart of the device or modifications to system settings unrelated to the core functionality of the app. For example, don’t encourage users to turn off Wi-Fi, disable security features, etc.
