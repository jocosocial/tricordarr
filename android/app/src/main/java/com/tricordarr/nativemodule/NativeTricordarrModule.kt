/*
 * This is a monolithic module for any native code that is needed in the app. Since patterns of multiple
 * native modules in a single repo are not super well documented yet we're gonna do this until that sorts
 * itself out.
 *
 * The big features we are likely to need here are:
 * - Photostream image text blurring
 * - Audio calling???
 *
 * "In general" modules are created the first time they are accessed and stick around.
