          If you are a Shadow Cruise event organizer you can optionally create a performer bio for yourself that is
          attached to the event you'll be running. This Bio page is not publicly linked to your Twitarr user. The intent
          of this feature is to let people thinking of attending your session know a bit about you.
        </HelpTopicView>
        <HelpTopicView>
          Performer Profiles for Shadow Cruise organizers can only be created before sailing. Long press the event in
          the Schedule screen and select Set Organizer to fill out the form. If you wish to create one while on board
          contact the TwitarrTeam for assistance. All profile content is subject to moderator review.

          You can add guests to your personal events. This will automatically create a Seamail chat for it. You can add
          or remove users later on. If you have already created your personal event you cannot add users later. You'll
          need to create a new personal event and add them at the time of creation.
