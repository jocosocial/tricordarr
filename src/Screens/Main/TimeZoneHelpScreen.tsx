          This should match clocks on the boat. But the Captain sets boat time, so if they don't match, boat clocks are
          right and Twitarr is wrong.

        <HelpTopicView title={'Device Time'}>
          Device time is the current time on the device you're holding in your hand.
        </HelpTopicView>
        <HelpTopicView>
          If the Boat Time and Device Time are different, you should change the time zone on your device until they
          match. This should be in your settings somewhere. If you can't find it, ask a tech nerd. There's probably one
          nearby.
